See the *Installation* part of the [README](https://gitlab.picoseq.org/analysis/trackanalysis/blob/master/README.md)
for installing the code.

Contributions are welcomed especially if:

1. Contributions are provided within a separate git branch. Its name should be
*your initials* followed by an underscore and then a descriptive name.
2. Code is documented (python/cpp/javascript) and annotated (python code).
3. The code builds: no errors occur when running the `python waf build` command.
4. The tests on your branch pass as revealed by [TeamCity](http://jupyter.depixus.com:8111/project/TrackAnalysis?branch=&buildTypeTab=overview).
5. The work is finalized using a formal [merge request](https://gitlab.picoseq.org/analysis/daqclient/merge_requests) to another member of the [group](https://gitlab.picoseq.org/analysis).

As a preference, the merge request should **squash commits** with a single well
informed commit message rather than leave a long list of *soon-to-be* obscure commit messages.
