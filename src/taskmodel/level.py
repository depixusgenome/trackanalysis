    Phase names in a cycle. Labeled phases are characterized by a stable magnet

    height is changed.

    The following describes the usual situation:

    * `initial`: phase 1 should be at the same magnet height (~10 pN of force) as
    `measure`. It could be used as a reference point.
    * `pull`: phase 3 is when the magnet is at the closest from the
    sample (18 pN of force). This is when a hairpin should unzip.
    * `measure`: phase 5 is when hybridisation events are measured (10 pN of force).
    * `relax`: phase 7 is used to remove probes from the hairpin.  The magnet
    is then at its farthest point (5 pN of force).
