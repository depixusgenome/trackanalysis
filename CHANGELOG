    ### rampapp_v1.2
        * Definition of a good bead has changed:
            For a given bead, if less than 20% of cycles do not open and close has expected
            the bead is tagged good. 
            Earlier versions of rampapp discarded a bead as soon
            as one of its cycle misbehaved.
        * creates a local server:
            once open the application runs in your webbrowser,
            to open another instance of rampapp, copy the address of rampapp (usually: http://localhost:5006/call_display)
            into a new window 
        * generates a ramp_discard.csv file for pias
        * added a third graph to display the estimated size of each hairpin in the trk files
