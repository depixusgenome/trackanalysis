# tag cycles_v1.0
## Tagger: Pol d'Avezac <pol.davezac@depixus.com>
New application for viewing cycles

* On the left plot:

    * Each cycle is displayed from yellow (first) to black (last)
    * The x-axis is the number of frames (bottom) or the duration in seconds (top)
    * The y-axis is in nanometers (left) or number of bases (right)
    * Use the mouse to see a given cycle.

* On the right plot:

    * The x-axis is the number of frames (bottom) or the number of cycles (top)
    * The y-axis is in nanometers (left) or number of bases (right)
    * The number of frames at a given *z* position is the gray histogram
    * The number of cycles at a given *z* position is the blue histogram. This
    is estimated as the number of cycles having 10 or more frames at that position.
    * Use the mouse to view the sequence at a given z.

    * The x-axis is the number of frames (bottom) or the duration in seconds (top)
    * The y-axis is in nanometers (left) or number of bases (right)
    * Use the mouse to see a given cycle.

* Viewing the sequence:
    * A single fasta file can be opened. It may contain multiple sequences.
    * The oligos can be selected. Using the Top/Bottom arrows should allow cycling
    over previously selected oligos.
    * The stretch and bias can be changed using either the sliders or the table
    displaying 2 positions (first and last theoretic peaks)

* Data cleaning includes:

    * alignment: either on phase 1 or phase 3
    * drift removal per bead: the correlation between cycles on a given bead is removed
    * drift removal per cycle: **use only if all beads are good!** The correlation between
    beads for each cycle is removed.

* Phase 5 can be viewed alone by selecting *Find events*.

* GR files can be loaded in 2 steps:

    * first open the corresponding *.trk* file: it is need to reconstruct exact cycle
    durations and number.
    * then open the *.gr* files. You can select all of them in one go.

    ### rampapp_v1.2
        * Definition of a good bead has changed:
            For a given bead, if less than 20% of cycles do not open and close has expected
            the bead is tagged good. 
            Earlier versions of rampapp discarded a bead as soon
            as one of its cycle misbehaved.
        * creates a local server:
            once open the application runs in your webbrowser,
            to open another instance of rampapp, copy the address of rampapp (usually: http://localhost:5006/call_display)
            into a new window 
        * generates a ramp_discard.csv file for pias
        * added a third graph to display the estimated size of each hairpin in the trk files 
        
# tag ramp_v1.3
## Tagger: David Salthouse <david.salthouse@depixus.com>
    ### rampapp_v1.3
        * user has now access to a slider (top-right) which allows to specify the ratio of cycles which the algorithm defines as correct to tag a bead as "good".
        Note that the 2 first cycles of the track file are still automatically discarded (as in pias)
