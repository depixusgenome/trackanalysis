Welcome to RampApp's documentation!
====================================

What is |RampApp| for ?
---------------------------------

The |RampApp| application has two goals:

#. It should allow the user to quickly judge the quality of a field of view.
#. It should tell the user which force to use for that field of view.

This is not for *offline* analysis. This is for to be used with ramp data prior
to testing oligos or antibodies.
